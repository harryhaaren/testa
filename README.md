Testa
=====

Testa is a small C based header file for testing.
It provides a simple way of templating tests, using
the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) syntax
from the Cucumber project.

This simple header file allows testing C code, without any
servers or dependencies - think of it as simple C unit-tests
but with the capabilities of injecting and checking values
just like Gherkin/Cucumber provides.
